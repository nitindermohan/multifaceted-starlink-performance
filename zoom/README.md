# Setup
## Get the data
Download the data set.

## Optional: Recompute the Zoom Statistics
We used the Zoom analysis tools published by Michel et al. [0] at [Princeton-Cabernet/zoom-analysis](https://github.com/Princeton-Cabernet/zoom-analysis) to compute Zoom statistics from captured packet traces at the call parties. Our data set already includes the computed metrics but you can optionally recreate them.

To recompute the traces, load the zoom analysis source by running `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
Please follow their compiliation instructions in [zoom-analysis/README.md](zoom-analysis/README.md) to build the `zoom_flows` and `zoom_rtp` binaries.
Make sure to include them in your PATH: `export PATH="$(pwd)/zoom-analysis/build:$PATH"`.

Process the files using our utility script: `bash process_pcaps.sh`

## Recreate the Plots
Set the environment variables `DATA_PATH` and `RESULT_PATH`. Run `bash plot.sh` to create the figure.
